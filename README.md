## Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
![Variable P Values] https://github.com/BBBrian1124/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Challenge/Images/D1_Variable_P_Values.PNG
* The P values tell us the probability that each variable/coefficient contributes to the variance to the model
  * In other words the higher the p value is, the higher the variable contributes to the variance
  * The lower the p value is, it means the variable(s) has an impact in predicting the dependent variable, and therefore it provides a non-random amount of variance
* Looking at the p values, the intercept, vehicle_length and ground_clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset
### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
![Model P Value] https://github.com/BBBrian1124/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Challenge/Images/D1_Model_P_Value.PNG
* Null and Alternative Hypothesis for linear regression is as follows:
  * H0 : The slope of the linear model is zero, or m = 0
  * Ha : The slope of the linear model is not zero, or m â‰  0
* The P value for our model is 5.35e-11 which is below the 'standard' 0.05 significance level therefore there is sufficient statistical evidence that our null hypothesis is not true, and therefore we would reject our null hypothesis
* Therefore, the slope of the linear model is not considered to be 0, as we have rejected H0 and 'accepted' Ha

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
![Model P Value] https://github.com/BBBrian1124/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Challenge/Images/D1_Model_P_Value.PNG
* The 'multiple R-squared' value represents how well the model approximates real world data points
* With a 'multiple R-squared' value of 0.7149, we can say the linear model strongly predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes 

## Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
### The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
![Variances] https://github.com/BBBrian1124/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Challenge/Images/D2_Variances.png
* Using R, we imported the data and created the summary stats (mean, median, variance and standard deviation) 
* We can see that lot 3 does not meet this specification since it has a variance of ~170
* The other lots, as well as the variance on the total lots do meet the specification since they are under the 100 PSI threshold

## Deliverable 3: T-Tests on Suspension Coils
### Determine if the PSI across all manufacturing lots, and each manufacturing lot is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch
![T-Test] https://github.com/BBBrian1124/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Challenge/Images/D3_T_Tests.png
* T-tests can be used for hypothesis testing
  * H0: there isn't a significant difference from the mean
  * Ha: there is a significant difference from the mean
* Where the P value exceeds the level of significance (0.05), we cannot reject the null hypothesis and therefore there isn't a significant difference, and the inverse is also true
* Only lot 3 has a P value lower than the level of significance therefore we reject the null hypotheses for lot 3 and say there is a statistical difference from the population mean
* For the other 2 lots, as well as the total of the lots, there is not a statistical difference from the population mean since the P value exceeds the level of significance we cannot reject the null hypotheses

## Deliverable 4: Study Design -  MechaCar vs Competition
* Statistical Study and Metrics: In comparing how the MechaCar compares against its competition, we can perform a statistical study on specific metrics to see how those metrics for MechaCar compare with their competitors. For example, one metric that can be tested is the cars' safety rating, which we can use to compare how safe MechaCar is compared to others 
* Hypothesis Testing: In our hypothesis, we can create the following null and alternative hypotheses 
 * H0: there isn't a significant difference from the mean (i.e. MechaCar's safety rating is similar to its competitors)
 * Ha: there is a significant difference from the mean (i.e. MechaCar's safety rating is not similar to its competitors)
* Statistical Tests: To test this hypothesis, we can perform a two sample T-tests; a Two-sample T-test answers the question: Is there a statistical difference between the distribution means from two samples (i.e. a sample of MechaCar vs. a sample of their competitors). The reason for completing this two sample T-test is that it will provide us insight into how MechaCar compares against our competitors and let us know what further questions need to be asked/investigated. For example, if there isn't a significant difference, then MechaCar is just "average" or similar to their competitors, and we can ask, how to we improve or become an industry leader in safety. If there is a significant difference, then we need to look at which way is the difference (i.e. worse or better than competitors) and then we can ask how to improve or what is setting MechaCar apart in safety and how can we continue those practices
* Data Needed: Data needed for this would be MechaCar's safety rating, as well as a list of competitors and their safety ratings. We may also want further information on what metrics are used to calculate the safety rating, then obtain data related to that. For example, if safety rating is based on # of air bags, ability to stop quicker, minimal framework damage on the vehicle, we may want data that can impact that such as quality of brake pads and materials used to build the vehicle
